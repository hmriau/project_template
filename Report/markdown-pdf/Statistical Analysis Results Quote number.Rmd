# About


This template is similar to the `03: My Template (HTML edit)`, but instead applies a custom LaTeX template. This is used to build the final output.


- this is 
- a

  - with sub items

# Introduction



# Results

```{r }
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



# Discussion


# Session Info

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
